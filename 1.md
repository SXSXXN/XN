For this demo, the sensor is plugged into the breadboard at a distance of 15cm from the heater and fan, however the sensor should be measuring the temperature around pets, which is further away than the current location. We know that the temperature T at a distance, d meters from a heat source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59886434/156245012-9d2071de-d795-467a-aff2-be04e59c0f37.png)
