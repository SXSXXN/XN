For this demo, the sensor is plugged into the breadboard at a distance of 15cm from the heater and fan, however the sensor should be measuring the temperature around pets, which is further away than the current location. We know that the temperature T at a distance, d meters from a heat source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59886434/156245012-9d2071de-d795-467a-aff2-be04e59c0f37.png)
For this demo, the sensor is plugged into the breadboard at a distance of 15cm from the heater and fan, however the sensor should be measuring the temperature around pets, which is further away than the current location. We know that the temperature T at a distance, d meters from a heat source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance
T∝1/d^2 
To convert it to an equation, multiply by k the constant of variation
T=k×1/d^2 =k/d^2 
When d = 15 cm, the temperature is measured to be 30℃, so k can be calculated using this given condition:
T=k/d^2 ⇒k=T×d^2=30×〖0.15〗^2=0.675
Then the equation is:
T=0.675/d^2
